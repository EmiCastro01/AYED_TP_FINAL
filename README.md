# AYED_TP_FINAL

This project simulates a system with routers and machines that can transfer
packages of data themselves......

# UPDATES

The project can generate de network between routers, with neighbors. Neighbors are stored on each
router with a queue of neighbor_t structures, that have the ID and cost.
The project can generate router->terminal connections, and generate a queue with
the terminals corresponding of each router. Every terminal has a unique ID.
